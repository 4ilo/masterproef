abstract = {In a visual driver-assistance system, road-sign detection and tracking is one of the major tasks. This study describes an approach to detecting and tracking road signs appearing in complex traffic scenes. In the detection phase, two neural networks are developed to extract color and shape features of traffic signs from the input scenes images. Traffic signs are then located in the images based on the extracted features. This process is primarily conceptualized in terms of fuzzy-set discipline. In the tracking phase, traffic signs located in the previous phase are tracked through image sequences using a Kalman filter. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in both detecting and tracking road signs present in complex scenes and in various weather and illumination conditions.},
